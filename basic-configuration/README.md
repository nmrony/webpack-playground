Baby Step
---------
This is baby step of webpack configuration. Here we use CommonJS module in browser using webpack. Check comments in `webpack.config.js` for detials. I see 95% posts on `Webpack` ends with `ReactJS`. New commers or want to learn `Webpack` only reading those posts may get an  impression that we can only use `Webpack` with `ReactJS`. Webpack is just a module bundler and it has no dependencis with React. Do not believe me. check this exmaple :smiley:
